# 🎧 Feel the Music Vibes! 🎶

This project turned out to be incredible. It has won my heart with every functionality it offers. 
I've added three of my recent favorite songs to the playlist. 🎶🔥 
I used JavaScript OOP and implemented Class-based structures in the project. The CSS part is entirely handcrafted, pure and simple. No CSS frameworks were used here! 😄✨

The languages I used are:
- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**

See you in the next project! 🌟👋😊
